# crop_analysis
This project is an analysis of agricultural data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The main goal is to analyze crop yields based on various factors such as temperature, rainfall, and pollution levels. The dataset used for this analysis is MD_agric_exam-4313.csv.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Zizu45/crop_analysis.git
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Start Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook crop_analysis.ipynb
Project Structure
The project includes the following files:

crop_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing the analysis code.
MD_agric_exam-4313.csv: CSV file containing the agricultural data.
Analysis Overview
Loading the Data: The CSV file MD_agric_exam-4313.csv contains the agricultural data. We use Pandas to load this data into a DataFrame in the Jupyter Notebook.

Data Cleaning: Before analysis, we clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

We perform exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of key variables such as temperature, rainfall, and crop types.
Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn help us gain insights into the data.
Analyzing Crop Yields:

We calculate the average annual yield for each crop type and visualize it.
Identify the crop types with the highest and lowest yields.
Correlation Analysis:

We explore the correlation between variables such as temperature, rainfall, and crop yields.
Heatmaps and scatter plots are used for visualization.
Usage
Open crop_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and see the analysis results.
Modify the code as needed for further exploration or customization.
Notes
The MD_agric_exam-4313.csv file should be in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file.
Feel free to modify the code and visualizations according to your requirements.
For detailed documentation on functions and methods used, refer to the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn official documentation.
